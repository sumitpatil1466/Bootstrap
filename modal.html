                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987), is an Indian international cricketer and the current
                        captain of India men’s cricket team in all formats. Considered one of the best batsmen of his
                        generation and one of greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known for his timing,
                        elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. He plays as a right-handed batsman for
                        India national cricket team in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in
                        domestic cricket. Rohit also captains Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles under his
                        leadership, the most by any team. With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007
                        T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both
                        tournaments.

                        Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day
                        International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs
                        and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for
                        which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two
                        national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in
                        2020. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup, the seventh time the country won the
                        title.

                        Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official
                        Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
                        (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless
                        cats and dogs in India.
                        Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[4] His mother, Purnima Sharma,
                        is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of
                        a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali
                        because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house
                        in Dombivli, only during weekends.[6] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[7]

                        Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp,
                        asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach
                        and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I
                        told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a
                        penny, and did well in my cricket".[7] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit
                        before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings.
                        He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on
                        debut as an opener.</p>
